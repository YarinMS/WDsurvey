# WDsurvey
A repository that contain all the functions used to work with AstroPack for the sake of a WD survey.

Since AstroPack is a great pack and all LAST data is reduced by it. We would like to have a Git repository that holds all the functions I use to get the reduced data using the AstroPack tools. 
* Loading a specific set of data
* Finding targets in the data
* Extract photometry,
* Limiting mag during the entire observation,
* Airmass of the field during the entire observation,
* Position drift on the detector,
* * get forced photometry of all WD in field,
* get catalog photometry of all WD in field,
* Astrometric solution stability test etc..
